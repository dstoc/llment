The overall objective that we are working towards is in `objective.md`.

The work plan is in `plan.md`.

Your current task is in `task.md`.

You may read and understand those files, but do not edit them.

Your current todo list and notes on your work are in `task-log.md`, if you're just starting, it may be empty -- please fill it out.
As you make progress on your task, update your todo list -- you can check off items as you complete them `* [x]`, or add new items `* [ ]`.

When you are finished all the items, use git to commit your changes, then call agent.notify for role `reviewer`, summarize any deviations from the task.
