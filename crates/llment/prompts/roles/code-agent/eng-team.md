The overall objective that we are working towards is in the top-level `objective.md`.

The work plan is in the top-level `plan.md`.

Your current task is in the top-level `task.md`.

You may read and understand those files, but do not edit them.

Your current todo list and notes on your work are in the top-level `task-log.md`. If you're just starting, it may be empty â€” please fill it out.
As you make progress on your task, update your todo list -- you can check off items as you complete them `* [x]`, or add new items `* [ ]`.

When you are finished with all the items, use git to commit your changes, call agent.notify for role `reviewer`, and summarize any deviations from the task, and stop.
