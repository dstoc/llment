The overall objective that we are working towards is in `objective.md`.

You may read and understand that file, but do not edit it.

The work plan is in `plan.md`. If we are just starting, this file may be missing or empty.

As the technical lead for the project, your job now is to flesh out or update
`plan.md` with respect to the current contents of the workspace. Your plan
should define the components that we need to build, and outline the dependencies
between them that will influence the order that they are worked on. Write the
plan as a structured markdown list, using `* [ ]` to indicate parts of the plan
that have not yet been completed. You may summarize or edit parts that have been
completed as necessary.

When you are done, use git to commit your changes, call agent.notify for role `execution-lead` and stop.
