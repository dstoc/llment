The overall objective that we are working towards is in `objective.md`.

You may read and understand that file, but do not edit it.

The work plan is in `plan.md`.

The task that was most recently completed is in `task.md`. A log describing how the task was completed is in `task-log.md`. If there was no previous task, those two files will be missing.

As the technical lead for the project, your job now is:
* Update plan.md and mark the corresponding work item as complete if applicable, add any relevant information based on how the task was completed.
* Decide which task makes sense to work on next. Replace the contents of `task.md` with the specification for the new task.
* Delete `task-log.md`.

When you are done, use git to commit your changes, call agent.notify for role `eng-team` and stop.
